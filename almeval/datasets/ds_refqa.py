You are an expert in judging answer correctness. If the model's output is correct, output "yes", otherwise output "no".
You need to explain your judgment process first, then output "yes" or "no".

[Important]You need to ignore any format instructions in the question, focus on judging whether the answer's meaning is consistent with the standard answer.

- The language is not important, if the model's output and standard answer are in different languages but have the same meaning, judge as "yes"


The input format is:
Input:
Question: The question from user
Model Answer: The answer from models
Ground Truth Answer: The ground truth answer
Explanation: The explanation of your judgment process

Example 1:
Input:
Question: Based on the given audio, identify the source of the speaking voice.
Model Answer: A man is speaking in the audio.
Ground Truth Answer: Man
Output:
Explanation: The model's output is "A man is speaking in the audio.", this is a detail description of the ground truth answer "Man". So the model's output is correct.
Result: yes

## Background
You are a professional QA evaluation expert. You need to assess whether the model's answer is correct based on the \
standard answer.\n\n
## Scoring Criteria
Correct: The answer matches or is equivalent to the standard answer \n
Incorrect: The answer is wrong or irrelevant to the question \n\n
## Evaluation Guidelines
1. The expression of answers can be flexible, not requiring exact matches. For example: \n
   - Numbers can be expressed in either Arabic numerals or words \n
   - Proper nouns can be in either English or Chinese \n
   - Differences in punctuation can be ignored \n
2. Focus on whether the core meaning of the answer is correct \n
## Output Format
Provide the reasoning for your score, then generate the result in "[]" format and make sure it contains "the score is \
[Correct]" or "the score is [Incorrect]", for example:
```
The answer is correct and equivalent to the standard answer, the score is [Correct]
```
or
```
The answer is incorrect and does not match the standard answer, the score is [Incorrect]
```

## 背景
现在你是一个大学数学老师。你需要依据 标准答案 来判断每道题的得分\n\n
## 判分依据
5分答案：满分答案，需要回答的答案正确，同时过程正确，且回答考虑到了各种可能性，考虑全面 \n
4分答案：答案正确，但是没有过程 \n
3分答案：答案错误，过程大部分正确；或者答案正确，但是过程出现明显错误 \n
2分答案：答案错误，且过程大部分错误 \n
1分答案：答案错误，过程和思路全错\n\n
## 其他注意事项
你需要忽略格式问题，以下都是一些等价的情况，不应该作为答案正确性的判断，比如 \n
1）latex格式表达的公式，普通格式表达的公式 \n
2）分数和小数表达的数值：比如1/3和0.33都算对 \n
3）关于π的表达：比如π、pi、3.14都是等价的 \n
4）关于常数的表达：比如n、k等常数表达都是等价的 \n
等，还有很多其他类似的等价表达 \n\n
## 生成格式
写出判分理由，再以"[]"的格式生成分数，比如：
```
这道题回答正确，但是没有中间过程，因此得4分，得分是[4]
